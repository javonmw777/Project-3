	Hello, my name is Javon Washington and I am here to apply for the job as a web developer, I’ve spend my four years in Benedict college studying the concepts of computers, how to develop websites, programming, and learning how to operate many different systems and networks. I have improved a lot in my web developing skills since I can understand the different tags, languages, and how to read many different codes. I’ve studied hard to earn my college degree on Computer Science and I wanna use that for my advance and try out for the spot as a software developer for Google headquarters.
